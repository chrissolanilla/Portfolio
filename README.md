# Welcome to my portfolio website. 

This website was made with a combination of sveltekit and tailwind using daisyui for the frontend, and node.js express for the backend(No database needed was my original goal/challenge!)

## Setting up the project

To start, clone the project. Then in the main directory run: 

```bash

npm install
npm run dev
```
To install the server, CD into the server directory and run: 
```bash

npm install
node index.js
```
## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
